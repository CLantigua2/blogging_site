              Hi, I'm a Full Stack Developer currently working at{" "}

              in Richmond, VA. I enjoy building robust user experiences with a
              mindfulness for accessibility. I like to write articles about
              tough problems I've solved and cool techy things I explore.
            </p>

            <h3>My Journey So Far</h3>
            <p>
              While I've always loved technology, I wasn't always a developer{" "}
              <span role="img" aria-label="surprised">
                üò≤
              </span>
              . At one point I was a US Marine and then a QA inspector for an
              air plane manufacturing company ‚úàÔ∏è. I began to self study
              programming in mid 2018 before attending Lambda School (a 9 month
              long coding school) in 2019. The school was intense{" "}
              <span role="img" aria-label="sweating">
                üòì
              </span>{" "}
              to say the least. Learned a lot of the basics for Full Stack Web,
              but there was still more to learn. After graduating I continued to
              build things and research every day. Eventually, I began working
              at SingleStone Consulting as a FullStack Developer. I've been
              fortunate to work with companies like VCU school of nursing,
              Andiron, and Capital One (on project #3 with them currently).

            <p>
              On my own time I volunteer to mentor students on my free time as
              well as explore fun technologies that catch my eyes. I actually
              have a list of technologies I'm interested in that I plan to some
              day get through.
